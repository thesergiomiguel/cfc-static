            Call for Curators specialises in spreading open calls from cultural
            organizations that need to reach curators and art managers. As we
            concentrate on this target audience, our communication is very
            efficient. Call for Curators announces job opportunities, grants,
            exhibition proposals, residencies, awards as well as symposia,
            seminars or curatorial studies programs.

            Our careful selection of information is rewarded with a high level
            of attention by our readers. Call for Curators is a magnificent
            tool, not only because of its selective content, but also because of
            the simple utilization.
          </p>

            This project would not be possible without the co-operation of the
            main international museums, arts centres, foundations, galleries,
            biennales or arts magazines.
